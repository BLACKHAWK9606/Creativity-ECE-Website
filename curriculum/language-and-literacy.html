            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Language and literacy are at the heart of communication and creativity. In early childhood, these skills begin long before reading or writing â€” through gestures, sounds, storytelling, drawing, and symbolic play. Creativity in this area involves making meaning through words, voice, rhythm, and visual symbols. Children explore language by listening, speaking, questioning, imagining, and sharing experiences. They engage in storytelling, mark-making, dramatic dialogue, and text-making. These experiences build not just vocabulary or phonics, but also confidence, critical thinking, empathy, and imagination. Fostering creativity in language and literacy equips children with the tools they need to communicate, understand others, and express themselves.</p>

            <h2>Creativity Theories & Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Vygotsky's theory of language and thought highlights how speech and creative play are interconnected in early learning. When children narrate their actions or invent stories, they're actively developing thought. Jerome Bruner's narrative theory emphasizes the role of storytelling in making sense of the world â€” children "think in stories" before formal logic develops. Gardner's multiple intelligences recognizes linguistic intelligence as a key creative strength. In Reggio Emilia, children are viewed as storytellers, with language seen as one of their "100 languages." These theories frame literacy not as rote skill-building, but as imaginative, expressive, and socially rich communication.</p>

              <h3>Resources & Technologies</h3>
              <p>To foster creativity in language and literacy, educators can use:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Books:</strong> picture books, wordless books, rhyming texts, and dual-language stories.</li>
                <li><strong>Storytelling tools:</strong> story stones, puppets, flannel boards, and photo cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Mark-making tools:</strong> crayons, chalk, whiteboards, paint, sand trays.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital tools:</strong> apps like Epic!, Book Creator, ChatterPix, and StoryJumper allow children to read, narrate, and create multimedia stories.</li>
                <li><strong>Recording tools:</strong> tablets or microphones to capture children's voices and stories.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Spaces that value oral language, print-rich environments, and imaginative story creation encourage young children to become confident communicators and storytellers.</p>

              <h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Learning Experience 1: "Story Basket Adventures" (Age Group: 2â€“3 years)</h4>
                <p>Children gather around a basket filled with themed props (e.g., forest animals, food, hats). They take turns pulling out items and helping the educator invent a group story: "One day, the bear found aâ€¦ hat!" Educators scaffold language, encourage participation, and build rhythm and excitement. This activity promotes emergent storytelling, vocabulary, group interaction, and narrative structure in a playful, low-pressure setting.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Learning Experience 2: "My Talking Book" (Age Group: 3â€“5 years)</h4>
                <p>Each child creates their own picture book using drawings, symbols, and invented spelling. With support, they use a tablet or app like ChatterPix to record themselves telling the story aloud. Pages are printed and read aloud at group time. This experience combines creativity, oral language, literacy skills, and digital fluency â€” while giving children ownership of their stories.</p>
