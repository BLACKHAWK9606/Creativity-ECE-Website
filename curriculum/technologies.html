            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In early childhood, technologies are more than digital devices â€” they include any tool or system used to design, create, communicate, or solve problems. Creativity in this area emerges when children engage in making, tinkering, coding, and designing using both digital and non-digital resources. Whether constructing a cardboard robot, using an iPad to animate a story, or exploring how buttons and levers work, children learn to connect ideas with tools. Technologies help children express themselves in new ways, develop logical thinking, and explore real-world applications of their imagination. With guidance, young learners develop confidence as creative, capable digital citizens.</p>

            <h2>Creativity Theories & Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Seymour Papert's constructionism emphasizes the power of learning through making with technology â€” children construct knowledge by creating meaningful projects. Gardner's multiple intelligences includes technological and spatial reasoning, showing how children express creativity through digital storytelling, visual design, or interactive media. Vygotsky's sociocultural theory supports co-learning through shared digital tasks and scaffolded interaction. The Reggio Emilia approach integrates digital tools as "languages of expression," alongside paint and clay. These perspectives validate technology as a medium for imaginative thinking, experimentation, and storytelling â€” not just screen time, but meaningful, creative engagement.</p>

              <h3>Resources & Technologies</h3>
              <p>To foster creativity in technologies, educators can use:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Tinkering tools:</strong> screwdrivers, tape, gears, wires, recycled materials for building inventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital tools:</strong> tablets, drawing apps, programmable toys (Bee-Bots, Blue-Bots), digital microscopes, and child-friendly cameras.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative software/apps:</strong> Book Creator, Tayasui Sketches, Stop Motion Studio, ScratchJr, and ABC Kids.</li>
                <li><strong>Recording and expression tools:</strong> microphones, storyboards, voice recorders, green screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction kits:</strong> coding robots, Makey Makey kits, or LEGOÂ® Spike.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Children should be free to explore both high- and low-tech tools as ways to problem-solve, design, and communicate ideas â€” all within safe, supervised environments.</p>

              <h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Learning Experience 1: "Digital Storytellers" (Age Group: 3â€“5 years)</h4>
                <p>Children use Book Creator or ChatterPix to illustrate and record their own short stories. They draw characters, type or dictate narration, and record voice-overs. Educators support sequencing and encourage imaginative expression. The final product is printed or shared on a class platform. This promotes digital literacy, narrative structure, and creative authorship.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Learning Experience 2: "Tech-Free Robot Challenge" (Age Group: 2â€“3 years)</h4>
                <p>Children are asked to build a "robot" using recycled materials (e.g., boxes, tubes, lids). They design with tape, glue, and paint, then describe their robot's purpose: "This robot makes sandwiches!" Educators help label parts and encourage storytelling about how it works. This blends engineering and imaginative design with language and dramatic play â€” no screens needed.</p>
