            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>An integrated curriculum connects subject areasâ€”like science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematicsâ€”into rich, meaningful learning experiences. In early childhood, integrated approaches such as STEM, STEAM (adding the arts), STREAM (adding reading), and STEMIE (adding inclusion and equity) help children make real-world connections and think holistically. These approaches support creativity by encouraging experimentation, innovation, and interdisciplinary thinking. Rather than isolating subjects, children explore how ideas interactâ€”designing, testing, imagining, and reflecting. Integrated learning taps into children's natural curiosity and nurtures critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving. It celebrates process over product and supports children as capable, creative constructors of knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Creativity Theories & Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Loris Malaguzzi's Reggio Emilia philosophy supports integration by recognising that children use "100 languages" to express and explore. Integrated learning allows these languagesâ€”drawing, storytelling, building, questioningâ€”to merge in dynamic ways. Papert's constructionism underpins STEM-based creativity: children learn best through making, experimenting, and designing solutions to problems. Gardner's multiple intelligences theory also validates the integration of logic, language, art, and movement as unique but connected creative strengths. Vygotsky's sociocultural theory emphasises the role of guided participation and peer interaction, both central to integrated projects. These perspectives collectively affirm that integrated learning fosters deep, creative engagement.</p>

              <h3>Resources & Technologies</h3>
              <p>Integrated learning thrives in environments offering:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Multidisciplinary tools:</strong> building blocks, scales, ramps, recycled materials, clay, paint, string, and magnifying glasses.</li>
                <li><strong>Coding toys:</strong> Bee-Bots, Cubetto, and Dash robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative software:</strong> Book Creator, ScratchJr, Stop Motion Studio, Osmo.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor exploration kits:</strong> clipboards, bug viewers, seed packets, and garden tools.</li>
                <li><strong>STEM challenge bins:</strong> with real-world prompts (e.g., build a shelter, make something that rolls).</li>
                <li><strong>Assistive tech (in STEMIE):</strong> switch-adapted toys, visual timers, and sensory tools to ensure accessibility.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These tools support inquiry, invention, and equity through hands-on, creative challenges.</p>

              <h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Learning Experience 1: "Design a Playground" (Age Group: 3â€“5 years)</h4>
                <p>Children work in small groups to design and build a model playground using cardboard, tape, paper tubes, and loose parts. They plan features like slides or swings and test the stability of structures. Educators prompt thinking: "What materials are strong?" or "How will we keep it safe?" Children document their designs and present them to peers. This integrates math, design, teamwork, and storytelling.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Learning Experience 2: "Water Explorer Station" (Age Group: 2â€“3 years)</h4>
                <p>A station with funnels, tubes, scoops, cups, and water wheels invites children to pour, mix, and build simple systems. They experiment with cause and effect: "What happens if I block the pipe?" Educators guide with questions and introduce new materials (e.g., sponges, sand). This supports sensory exploration, spatial reasoning, and early science/engineering concepts in an accessible, joyful format.</p>
