            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Science in early childhood education encourages children to observe, question, explore, and discover. It nurtures a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world â€” what things are, how they work, and why changes happen. Creativity in science is seen when children hypothesise, experiment, and use imaginative thinking to solve problems or explain observations. Through hands-on play with nature, materials, and cause-effect relationships, children begin to understand basic scientific principles. Creativity and science are not opposites â€” they work together. Scientific learning allows children to think divergently, express ideas, and construct knowledge in engaging, meaningful ways.</p>

            <h2>Creativity Theories & Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Jean Piaget's cognitive developmental theory supports the idea that young children learn science concepts through active exploration and interaction with their environment. As they manipulate materials, they build cognitive schemas through trial and error. Carl Jung and Carl Rogers both highlighted the importance of open-ended exploration for creative growth. Vygotsky emphasized the role of language in scientific dialogue and scaffolding. Creativity in science also connects to Gardner's naturalistic intelligence, which recognizes the ability to classify, observe patterns, and make sense of the natural world. Together, these perspectives affirm that creativity is essential in the development of early scientific thinking.</p>

              <h3>Resources & Technologies</h3>
              <p>To support creative scientific thinking, educators can use:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural materials:</strong> leaves, water, sand, sticks, seeds, pebbles, magnets, shells.</li>
                <li><strong>Investigation tools:</strong> magnifying glasses, pipettes, measuring cups, balance scales, mirrors.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensory bins:</strong> themed around weather, textures, insects, or colours.</li>
                <li><strong>Science books and charts:</strong> showing life cycles, weather, seasons, and animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital tools:</strong> apps like Seek by iNaturalist, Little Alchemy, or Star Walk Kids for digital exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Recording tools:</strong> clipboards or tablets for drawing hypotheses, results, or diagrams.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A well-equipped inquiry space invites children to test, explore, and make discoveries using creative and critical thinking.</p>

              <h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Learning Experience 1: "Floating and Sinking" (Age Group: 3â€“5 years)</h4>
                <p>Children are given a tub of water and a variety of materials (plastic, wood, sponge, coins, fabric, leaves). They predict which objects will float or sink and then test their predictions. Educators guide with questions: "What do you notice?" or "What could we try next?" Children draw their findings and invent theories ("This rock is heavy like my shoe!"). This fosters observation, experimentation, and early scientific reasoning.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Learning Experience 2: "Mini Weather Lab" (Age Group: 2â€“3 years)</h4>
                <p>Children explore temperature, light, and rain through a mini-lab setup. They touch frozen sponges, observe light through prisms, and watch "rain clouds" made with shaving cream and coloured water in clear cups. Educators narrate the process and introduce terms like "melting," "cold," "light," and "pouring." This multisensory experience supports language, sensory play, and concept development in a creative, playful format.</p>
