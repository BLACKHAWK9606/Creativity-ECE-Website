      <h2 class="mb-3" style="color:#6c63ff; font-weight:700;">Introduction and Significance of Creativity</h2>
      <p>Creativity forms the cornerstone of early childhood education, opening young minds to innovate and discover. In a world where adaptability is the need, creative pedagogy in the curriculum equips children with self-expression and problem-solving. Lin (2011) proposes a framework for creative pedagogy, underlining its importance to develop imagination between 0-8 years. It transforms learning into an active process, where children develop and thrive from play and exploration. For educators, making creativity a part of their teaching is not optional—it's necessary to prepare children for the challenge ahead, so it's addressed across all domains of the curriculum.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3" style="color:#f8b500; font-weight:700;">Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
      <p>Theories of creativity, like Vygotsky's social constructivism, highlight the importance of guidance during the early years. Lin's (2011) model supports this, suggesting that teachers scaffold children's thoughts to promote originality. Views are different—some opine that creativity is a natural ability, and others consider it to be a capacity gained by experience. Zhang et al. (2023) found that a sense of belonging and friendship among peers nurtures classroom creativity, particularly in young children. This theory setting integration highlights the significance of personalized strategies so that every child, from a baby to 8-year-olds, has opportunities to grow creatively.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3" style="color:#6c63ff; font-weight:700;">Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
      <p>Effective teaching relies on different resources. For preschoolers, papers, crayons, and clay encourage imagination, while electronic materials like tablets engage interactive learning. Sensory bins with safe textures offer 0-2-year-olds stimulation. Large drawing boards are appropriate for 2-3-year-olds, while storytelling software is appealing to 3-5-year-olds. Between the ages of 6-8, coding games become helpful to encourage creative thinking. Electronic devices like interactive whiteboards, project display, but done in moderation to avoid excessive use of the screen. Teachers must select proper materials for the age and provide accessibility and safety to ensure maximum participation throughout the curriculum.</p>
